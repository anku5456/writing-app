Since I can't pay child support to her I have to see my son twice a week and have a every other weekend visit.

I felt that would be fair because of the phone call and email.

Then, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, he recovered himself and rushed forward, pushing past me,

At first, I didn't know what to think.
Was he okay?
What the hell was going on?
I had never seen him like this.

But if I want to continue the job I've got now, I've got to make some room in the bed to sit down.
And make the space work.
I'm not one to stay up late watching TV.
My eyes get all puffy and everything.
I watched a movie last night that I've been wanting to see for a long time, called Quills.
It's from the 1970's and about a guy, who's an architect, whose wife dies.
He becomes a recluse.

He probably won't get back together with his ex, if he really loved her, because she's got too much baggage for a man

At some point in our lives, we had all done things that we're not proud of, and neither are you.
